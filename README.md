## Instructions:

Install the Retro Dev Tools repository

```

git clone https://github.com/cityxen/retro-dev-tools

```


### Windows

Add Retro Dev Tools bin-win folder to your environment path. Example: https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/

Alternatively, you can type it on the command line

```

set PATH=%PATH%;X:\path\to\retro-dev-tools\bin-win\

```

Restart Computer

### Linux

Add Retro Dev Tools bin-linux folder to your environment path.

```

echo "export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/retro-dev-lib/bin-linux" >> ~/.bashrc

```

Restart Computer

## After Installation

Now you have the power of the Retro Dev Tools at your disposal.

All you have to do now is edit your asm file, then run the script. If you have everything installed properly, it should compile your program, place it into a disk file, and then run that disk file in the appropriate emulator.

### Windows

```

Build.bat

```

### Linux

```

./build_linux.sh

```
